    <h2 id="basic">Basic Training</h2>
    <p> Basic training is your introduction to EMDR therapy and a requirement to become certified in this evidence based
      therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There are many organizations and solo trainers who provide this
      training. Every training must include 20 hours of lecture, 20 hours of practicum and 10 hours of consultation.
      During your training, you will learn the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model</li>
      <li>The 8 phases and 3 prongs of EMDR</li>
      <li>The mechanics of EMDR</li>
      <li>EMDR with special populations</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Once you complete the EMDR training you will be considered trained and can use the therapy with your patients.

    <p>If you want to demonstrate competence in EMDR therapy, certification is the next step. After you complete your
      training, including the 10 hours of consultation, theres steps are required for certification.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>20 hours of consultation
        <p>10 of the hours can be in group. 10 must be individual. Of the 10 individual consultation hours, 5 can be
          with a consultant in training and 5 must be with an approved consultant.</p>
      </li>
      <li>7 hours of continued education</li>
      <li>50 hours of EMDR with at least 25 clients</li>
      <li>A letter of recommendation from a peer</li>
      <li>A letter of completion from your EMDR consultant</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="cons">Consultation</h2>

    <p>Consultation will focus on your ability to use the standard protocol successfully with your patients. Some
      consultants have areas of specialization such as dissociation or substance abuse. While specialization can be
      included, the standard protocol will be the main focus. Things to consider when choosing a consultant:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Specialization: Does the consultant work with the population you work with?</li>
      <li>Does the consultant have in person or virtual availability?</li>
      <li>Is the consultant organized: Do they have a contract with expectations?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You have the opportunity to switch consultants. Be careful of committing to one consultant with a package deal
      until you are sure they are a good match.</p>
